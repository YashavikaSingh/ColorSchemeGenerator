# Color Palette Generator

This app was all me, no tutorial, just a little help from chatgpt along the way.
The app generates random colors and lets you copy their hex values to clipboard.
You can also lock in some hex values and then shuffle the unlocked colors.

The save button saves the colors on the screen. The saved colors can be viewed on tapping the "view saved colors" button.
